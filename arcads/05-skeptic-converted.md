# Script 05: Skeptic Converted

**Angle:** Ready to quit outbound, friend recommendation
**Hook:** "I'm gonna be honest — I was ready to quit outbound"

[sighs] I'm gonna be honest — I was ready to quit outbound entirely. I'd tried VA's, I'd tried agencies, I'd tried doing it myself. Nothing worked. I was spending money and getting nothing back.

[mischievously] Then my buddy kept bugging me about Agentss. [laughs] I finally caved just to shut him up.

[excited] First week, four meetings booked. Real ones. People who actually wanted to talk. I didn't write a single email.

[curious] I went from "outbound doesn't work for my business" to [excited] "outbound is my best channel" in like a month. [laughs] I was wrong. This thing works. Link's below.
