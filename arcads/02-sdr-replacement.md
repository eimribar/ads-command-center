# Script 02: SDR Replacement

**Angle:** Cost comparison vs hiring
**Hook:** "I was about to hire a junior SDR"

[curious] I was about to hire a junior SDR. Salary, benefits, training, management time — looking at like 60-70K all in. [sighs] And they'd probably take months to ramp.

[excited] Then I found Agentss. Fraction of the cost. No training. No management. Works weekends and holidays.

[mischievously] First month it booked more qualified meetings than what I was expecting from a human hire in their first quarter.

[firmly] I'm not saying don't hire people. But if you're a small business trying to grow without a massive payroll — [excited] this is the smarter move right now. Link below.
