# Script 04: Mental Energy

**Angle:** Brain freedom, mental load relief
**Hook:** "Here's something no one talks about"

[curious] Here's something no one talks about — the mental energy of sales outreach. It's not just the hours. [sighs] It's the constant switching, the rejection, the follow-ups living in your head.

[excited] I found Agentss and honestly just wanted my brain back. Set it up, gave it my ICP, let it run.

[relieved] Now I wake up, check my calendar, and there's meetings. I didn't think about them. I didn't stress about them. They just appeared.

[mischievously] That mental freedom? Worth more than the meetings themselves. [firmly] If your brain is fried from doing your own outreach — this is the fix. Link below.
