# Script 06: Solopreneur

**Angle:** One-person show, no team, no budget
**Hook:** "So I run my business completely solo"

---

[curious] So I run my business completely solo. No team, no budget for a sales hire. Which meant I was the sales guy, the ops guy, the everything guy. [sighs] I'd spend my mornings prospecting instead of actually doing the work I love.

[skeptical] Tried Agentss thinking it probably wouldn't work for my niche. Set it up in like 20 minutes and forgot about it.

[excited] Three days later I get a notification — meeting booked. Then another. Then another. [laughs] I literally laughed out loud.

[mischievously] Now I just show up to calls and close. That's it. [firmly] If you're a one-person show trying to do it all — you need this. Link's below.
