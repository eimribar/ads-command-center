# Script 07: Burnout Rescue

**Angle:** Burning out from DIY outreach, desperate skeptic
**Hook:** "So I'm a small business owner doing all my own sales outreach"

---

[sighs] So I'm a small business owner doing all my own sales outreach. Building lists at midnight, sending cold emails, following up with people who ghost me — barely booking any calls. Burning out.

[skeptical] Someone told me to try Agentss and I was like... great, another AI tool that's gonna half-work and waste my time. But I was desperate, so I set it up.

[excited] Within a week, qualified meetings showing up on my calendar. I didn't build the list. I didn't write the emails. It just... did it.

[mischievously] Now I tell every business owner I know. [laughs] It gave me back hours every week. [firmly] Stop doing outreach yourself. Link below.
